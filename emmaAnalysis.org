* Emma words ayalysis
Today I write a short program to analysis the words of fiction Emma.
To list the words showed in the fiction and how many times are they showed in it.
And sort by the frequence.

It turns out that first frequent simple words has nearly 50% of the fiction.
amazing result.

    for line in fp:
        process_line(line, hist)

    line = line.replace('-', ' ')

    for word in line.split():
        word = word.strip(string.punctuation+string.whitespace)
        word = word.lower()

        hist[word] = hist.get(word, 0) + 1

hist = process_file('emma.txt')

if len(hist)<10:
    readlinenum = len(hist)

itemTList = hist.items()
#print(len(itemTList))    #7214 words

#reverse the tuple value and key for sort

    wordnum = itemTList[i][1]
    itemTList[i] = (wordnum, word)
